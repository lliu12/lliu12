I'm Lucy, an Applied Math PhD student at Harvard. I am very thankful to be advised by L. Mahadevan  and Justin Werfel, and supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

I organize the <a href="https://softmath.seas.harvard.edu/seminars/qed/">QED seminar series</a> on quantitative ecology, ethology, and evolution - come join us for one of the talks sometime!
